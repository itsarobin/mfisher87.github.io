# TODO

- Create a "project history" page which can serve as canonical descriptions/records of
  the software I've worked on, including rich links to source code, clear description
  of my role, etc. Then I can link to that page from my resume, elsewhere.
- pre-commit: codespell
- Update ORCiD page (and add Zenodo integration if needed):
  - earthaccess
  - snow today
  - usaon
  - nsidc0102
  - ??
