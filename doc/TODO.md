# TODO

- Use Carpentries re-usable text for instructors? https://github.com/carpentries/commons/blob/main/text-for-instructors.md


## Details about interests

I used to have (a superset of) this text on the home page. It's less detailed now.

* Open Science and open-source software; teaching scientists how to use Git
* Data visualization quality (e.g. appropriate and accessible colormaps)
* Software documentation quality
* Infrastructure and operations as code
* Music
* DIY electronics and repair


## My work

* Create maintenance page
    * Earthaccess: maintenance and/or core contributor?


## ORCiD page updates

Consider whether each of these repos also needs Zenodo integration.
