# TODO

- Use Carpentries re-usable text for instructors? https://github.com/carpentries/commons/blob/main/text-for-instructors.md


## Details about interests

I used to have (a superset of) this text on the home page. It's less detailed now.

* Open Science and open-source software; teaching scientists how to use Git
* Data visualization quality (e.g. appropriate and accessible colormaps)
* Software documentation quality
* Infrastructure and operations as code
* Music
* DIY electronics and repair


## Details about skills

Right now, there's no place for this, just for experience. "Skills" doesn't fit very
well in "My work", so is there another way we can rename that category so it does fit?


## My work

* Create maintenance page
    * Earthaccess: maintenance and/or core contributor?


## ORCiD page updates

Consider whether each of these repos also needs Zenodo integration.
