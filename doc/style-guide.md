# Style guide

## Blog posts

### Voice

* Direct; writing should be succinct and to the point
* Personal and informal is OK up to a point
    * For example, avoid opening a blog post with "Knock knock. Who's there? It's me,
      Matt, and ..."
    * Talking about my passions, hobbies, sense of humor, learning style, etc. is fine.
      Using some limited slang is probably fine, but consider inclusiveness (English may
      not be every readers' first language, and slang dialect is an unnecessary layer of
      obfuscation).
* Use emoji liberally in headings; very conservatively in prose.
    * Emojis at the beginning of the heading, not at the end.
    * If positioning an emoji in the middle of the heading, there should be a really
      good reason.


### Structure

* Short sections broken up in to little subsections, each with headings/subheadings.
* Short paragraphs.


#### General format

* Recap/TLDR: Summarize everything! Spoil the solution.
* Introduction: Sets up a problem.
* Body: Describes a solution in detail.
* Conclusion: Wrap-up, why you should do this.
