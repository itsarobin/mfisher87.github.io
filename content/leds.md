This is my place for writing down which LED bulbs have been working out and which
haven't. I'll update as I see failures or other problems.

For LEDs, I care about:

* Color reproduction (high CRI/R9 value)
* Not annoying (doesn't flicker, doesn't buzz, dims if dimmable)
* Longevity
    * Can be predicted (?) by number of diodes; fewer brighter diodes will wear out
      faster than more dimmer diodes.

I have not done any empirical testing. All conclusions on this page are subjective.

I try to avoid re-purchasing bulbs/brands I've had bad experiences with, so it's
possible some of the brands I've abandoned are solely due to bad luck! Your mileage may
vary.

## Bad experience

* Cree `TBR30-06527FLFH25-12DE26-F`: Purchased around 2 dozen bulbs at Home Depot ~2019.
  3 have failed either by becoming flickery, buzzing loudly, or ceasing to light at all.
* Cree `TA1908050MDFH25-120E26-1`: Unknown purchase date, unknown failure symptoms. I
  just have more of these in my bulb recycling box than I would like.
