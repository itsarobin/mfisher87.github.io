title: "Our 2024 garden"
---

Myself and my partner, [Robin](https://itsarobin.github.io), grow a garden to help
sustain ourselves and our local wildlife in Boulder County, Colorado (USDA Zone 6A).


## Spaces

:::{.callout-note}
### _TODO_

* Pictures
* What plants will be in what spaces?
:::

### Everywhere

* Marigolds: We re-seed these every year by hand from the previous years' plants, and we
  always have more than we can handle.
* Hyssop (anise & wild): Same treatment as marigolds. Attract dragonflies, butterflies,
  hummingbirds, bees.
* Yarrow: Same treatment as
* Perrenial succulents
* _TODO: Other wildflowers / perrenials we want to plant indiscriminantly_


### Front yard

* 6 tall (~1m) raised beds of varying shapes and sizes. These mostly receive full
  sun.
    * _TODO: Sun-lovers, e.g. tomato, pepper, cucumber, zucchini, ... Which plants would
      need shade cloth in hottest months?_
* 3 whisky(?) barrel planters in partial sun.
    * Green onions
    * _TODO: What else?_
* A short, long raised bed that receives mostly shade.
    * Strawberries
    * Columbine
    * Rhubarb
    * Thyme
    * _TODO: Leafy greens?_


### Back yard

* 2 stock tank planters, 4' and 6' long. These receive full sun.
    * Chives
    * _TODO: Sun-lovers. Tomatoes? What else?_
* 2 strips of garden space, about 2-3' wide and 20' long, next to our fences running
  north-south. One receives morning sun, and one receives afternoon sun.
    * Raspberries
    * _TODO: What else?_


## Planting schedule

:::{.callout-note}
### _TODO_

* What plants will we plant when? When will they be harvested?
* How to arrange this info? Markdown table (ew)?
:::

* Carrots: Plant all season every two weeks, March(?) through October(?). Leave some carrots for
  harvest in January; these will be very sweet.
* Broccoli / other brassica: Plant for growth in cool season. _TODO: Dates_
* Onions / other allium: Plant in early spring.
    * Garlic: Planted in Fall 2023.
* Leafy greens: Plant in early spring.


### Tender plants

Should not experience a frost after planting. Can be protected with "wall of water" to
plant earlier and get more growth time.

* Tomatoes
* Peppers
* Zucchini
* Cucumbers
* Melons
* Most herbs (oregano, basil, marjoram, ...) _TODO: Detail_
    * Rosemary: Most varieties won't survive the winter here.


### Misc.

* Thyme: Many varieties survive the winter. Divide existing plants.
* Chives: Grows as a perrenial. Divide existing plants.
