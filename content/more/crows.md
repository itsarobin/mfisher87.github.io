Crows are awesome! I (and my partner, Robin) want to make friends with crows. These are
our notes.


## Preferred food

So far, we've mostly tried in-shell, raw, unsalted peanuts, and some dog treats. Both
work OK.

We purchased some spicy suet for birds (birds can't taste capsaicin, but mammals like
squirrels can), but haven't encountered any crows in the neighborhood since then.


## Locations

We see small groups of crows in our neighborhood on average probably every two weeks. We
often can't find any crows within running/biking distance of our house, so they must be
traveling significant distances.

Are there any patterns we can identify? I'd like to start a dataset that tracks crow
sightings and locations, ideally one that others can contribute to.


## Measures of success

We will feel like we've established a friendship with crows if:

* They will come within arms' reach to get food
* They establish a regular visit schedule at our house
* They bring us shiny trash gifts

So far, the best measure of success has been that the crows are comfortable hanging out
with us on our driveway, if we sit still. They will come within 10 feet of us to get
food, but react fearfully to movement.

Talking to them (e.g. gentle coaxing like a dog or cat) seems to be surprisingly
effective at making them more comfortable with getting morsels of food that are closer
to us.
